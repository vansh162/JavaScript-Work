    3. Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Vehicle' with properties for make, model, and year. Include a method to display vehicle details. Create a subclass called 'Car' that inherits from the 'Vehicle' class and includes an additional property for the number of doors. Override the display method to include the number of doors.

<script>
    class vehicle{
        make;
        model;
        year;
        constructor(make,model,year){
            this.make=make;
            this.model=model;
            this.year=year;
        }
        display(){
            console.log(`Make:${this.make},Model:${this.model},Year:${this.year}`);
        }
    }

    class car extends vehicle{
        doors;
        constructor(make,model,year,doors){
            super(make,model,year);
            this.doors=doors;
        }

        display(){
            console.log(`Make:${this.make},Model:${this.model},Year:${this.year}`);
        }
    }

    const carx =new car("KIA",123,2020,4);
    const carx2 =new car("Toyota",123,2020,5);

    carx.display();
    carx2.display();
