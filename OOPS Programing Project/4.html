<script>
    class BankAccount{
        accNumber;
        balance;
        constructor(accNumber,balance=0){
            this.accNumber=accNumber;
            this.balance=balance;
        }

        deposit(amount){
            if(amount>0){
                this.balance+=amount;
                console.log(`Deposit:${amount},Balance:${this.balance}`);
            }
            else{
                console.log("Incorrect amount for deposit.....");
            }
        }

        withdraw(amount){
            if(amount<=this.balance && amount>0){
                this.balance-=amount;
                console.log(`Withdraw:${amount},Balance:${this.balance}`);
            }
            else if(amount>this.balance){
                console.log("Not enought balance");
            }
            else{
